# Citi-Bike-Analytics
<br>
For this project, I created visualizations on Tableau to help city officials evalute the New York CitiBike program. Three main ideas were explored: the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on CitiBike usage, top station locations, and peak hours of use. <br>

## The following key insights were revealed:<br>
### In March 2020, states across the US including NY went into quarantine and many businesses had to close their doors to customers. How did CitiBike fare in the wake of the pandemic?<br>
The number of rides taken on CitiBikes was most impacted in April 2020-right after NY went into a state of emergency. After the inital impact, the number of rides resumed as normal in August 2020 and was higher than 2019 in December when comparing the years across the same dates. Average trip durations in the selected months were higher overall in 2020 than in 2019.<br>
<br>
The percent of users registered as subscribers decreased from 90.30% in 2019 to 81.51% in 2020. However, the overall number of rides increased from 149,856 to 312,690 in 2020 when comparing April, August, and December 1 data.<br>
<br>

### What were the most popular start and end CitiBike stations in 2019-20?<br>
Many of the top start locations are the same as the top end locations, proving these are the most popular locations for CitiBike rentals overall!<br>
<br>
Top 3 Locations Overall: <br>

1. Pershing Square North<br>
2. 12 Ave & W 40 St<br>
3. West St & Chambers St<br>
<br>

### What were the peak hours for CitiBike riders in 2019-20?<br>
In 2019, despite the season, the peak start and end times align with peak commuter times.<br>
<br>
In 2020, despite the season, the peak start and end times are not as concentrated as they were in 2019 to commute times. The hours of the day users are starting and ending their rides is more spreadout throughout the day.<br>
